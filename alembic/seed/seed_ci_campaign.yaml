# This example YAML implements a small CI campaign
---
# The campaign creates a namespace for other objects, note that the campaign
# metadata.name should match the metadata.namespace of all additional manifests
# The campaign can be also set for the `cm` commandline tool via either the
# `CM_CAMPAIGN` environment variable or positional argument when loading

# because the campaign is not versioned the way other manifests are, so changes
# to this configuration (spec) is not tracked the same way. It is ok to set static
# information parameters for a specific manifest type here, but the campaign
# comes last in the configuration lookup hierarchy!
