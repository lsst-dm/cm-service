"""FastAPI routers

Many of these routers are built using function templates defined in
lsst.cmservice.routers.wrappers

Most of these routers implement functions that manipulate individual
database tables.   Those routers will typically define a view variables
that specify which table is being manipulated, and then populate the
router using the wrapper template functions.


The exceptions to this pattern are:

index: top-level index
actions: specfic database actions
adders: adding things to the database (such as campaigns, steps or groups)
loaders: reading yaml files an loading objects into the database
queries: getting objects from the database
