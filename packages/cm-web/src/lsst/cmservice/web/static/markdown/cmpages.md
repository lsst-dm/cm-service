- Every page in CM Service has a header, a side panel menu, and a footer.
Each page may display different information in these sections, but a "help" button is always present in the footer, and will bring you back to this help section.
Similarly, every page header has a "Campaign Management" label that is a link back to the Campaign Overview page.

- *Campaign Overview*. The main home page of CM Service.
This page shows a card for each campaign known to CM Service.
On each card is an Avatar, the campaign name and status, a histogram of node-statuses, and a pause/resume switch.
Additional buttons allow you to "favorite" or "hide" a campaign.
You may also "clone" a campaign to make a copy of its graph and configuration, or "export" the campaign for offline use.

- *Campaign Detail*. Each card on the *campaign overview* page is linked to a *Campaign Detail* page for that campaign.
On this detail page, you can access a Mermaid rendering of the campaign graph, review gauges that display the campaign progress, review and edit any Campaign Manifests, and review and edit any Nodes in the campaign.
The collection of campaign nodes is displayed as a set of Node Detail cards or a simplified Table, with a switch between the two views available in the side panel menu.
Node Detail cards have richer content but are consequently more visually complex; the table view is simpler but has a restricted set of available operations.
